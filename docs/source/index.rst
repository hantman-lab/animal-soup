Summary
=======

``animal-soup`` is an automated behavioral classification software that allows members of the UNC
Hantman Lab to quickly and efficiently generate ethograms for their reach-to-grab behavioral data.
It is a collection of "pandas extensions", which are functions that operate on pandas DataFrames.
It essentially creates a user-friendly "psuedo-database" of your behavioral data, interfacing with
with `fastplotlib <https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib>`_ for fast visualization and editing of
predicted behavioral labels.
